# permutation-non-dup
code has three inputs 1.String of numbers 2. String of operators, ex: *-+ 3. target int value. 
The output is different permutation combining string of numbers and string of operators that evaluate to the target integer.
ex: input1 string is 123, input2 string is *-+ and input 3 is 5, so probable strings that evaluate to 5 are 2*1+3 and 1*2+3
